# Babelouest

I prefer when I use self-hosted services, so I can trust them since I know better what they do and how they do it. Therefore when a self-hosted service doesn't exist or doesn't meet my needs, or I feel like I want to do it, I build micro services and web applications for my own needs.

Eventually, a simple Raspberry PI can host all of the following programs.

## Pograms
- [Glewlwyd](https://babelouest.github.io/glewlwyd): OAuth2 authentication server providing Json Web Tokens
- [Taliesin](https://babelouest.github.io/taliesin): Lightweight audio streaming server, to listen to all of your music everywhere
- [Hutch](https://babelouest.github.io/hutch): Online password and secret locker
- [Angharad](https://babelouest.github.io/angharad): House automation system

## Arduino project
- [Taulas](https://github.com/babelouest/taulas): Arduino source files for Angharad system devices

Here are the main libraries developped to help building the programs above.

## Libraries
- [Ulfius](https://babelouest.github.io/ulfius/): HTTP Framework for REST API in C, using JSON or not, with websockets or not, with streaming data or not
- [Hoel](https://babelouest.github.io/hoel): C Database abstraction library with json based language 
- [Yder](https://github.com/babelouest/yder): Logging library for C applications
- [Orcania](https://github.com/babelouest/orcania): Potluck with different functions for different purposes that can be shared among C programs

## Misc
- [Huddersfield](https://github.com/babelouest/huddersfield): Project packages builder and publisher
